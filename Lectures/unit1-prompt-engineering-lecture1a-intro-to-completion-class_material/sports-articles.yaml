  ARLINGTON, Texas -- Ohio State coach Ryan Day took responsibility for "not getting the guys ready to play" in 
  Wednesday night's 24-14 loss to Miami, which knocked the defending national champion out of the College Football 
  Playoff in the quarterfinals. "We worked really hard ... to come out of the gates and win the first quarter, win 
  the first half and be ready to go," Day said. "I thought we had an excellent plan. But at the end of the day, 
  we didn't get it done. That starts with me."

  Early rounds have produced some of the sport’s sharpest shocks, especially when established teams underestimated 
  tactical flexibility. Bengal Warriors’ 2016 qualifier win over Jaipur remains a benchmark, largely because a late 
  defensive stand erased a double-digit gap. Many fans following Kabaddi through a betting app in Pakistan still 
  reference that match because Jaipur’s attack stalled without warning. Analysts cite it as a turning point that 
  showed how quickly a confident favourite can lose structure.
