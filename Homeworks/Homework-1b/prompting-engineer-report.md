Interesting thigs that I found is that oddly enough, without any context of what the numbers of the csv file are, gpt-5-nano gave me the most interesting results. It seemed that if the model doesn't seem sure of what a number is, it just creates a general variable such as n1, n2, and n3 instead of guessing. In the contrary, the other models were more often to guess, and the older the model, the more likely it is for it to guess wrong.
